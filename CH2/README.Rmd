## CH. 2 The R Language for Statistical Computing

This is an README of CH. 2 of Financial-Analystics-with-R. This chapter is talking about statistical computing in R programming.

Review abou R assignment operators. There are four assignment operators:
1. <- basic operator
2. =  basic operator
3. =  assign parameter values in function
4. <<-super-assignment operator 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
